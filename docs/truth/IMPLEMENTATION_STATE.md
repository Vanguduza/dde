# DDE Implementation State — Rev 3

**Status:** CANONICAL CURRENT-STATE SNAPSHOT  
**Snapshot date:** 2026-09-02  
**Architecture:** `docs/truth/BLUEPRINT_REV3.md`  
**Plan:** `docs/truth/DEV_PLAN_REV3.md`

## 0. How to use this file

This document answers: **what is actually implemented now?**

It must remain evidence-based. Do not mark a feature complete because it appears in the blueprint, a schema exists, a test fixture exists, or an agent reported success.

Allowed state labels:

- `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED`
- `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `PLANNED`
- `BLOCKED_DECISION`
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`
- `DEFERRED`
- `HISTORICAL`

Every state transition should cite concrete repository evidence: commit, chapter gate, code paths, tests or verification artifacts.

## 1. Repository heads observed during Rev 3 bootstrap

### Last observed product implementation head before Rev 3 truth-doc commits

`c30d2969e3205d1a277dd128e8b182137a8892e0` — **DDE-067 Frontend Studio surface** — 2026-08-27.

The preceding implementation sequence visible in recent commits includes:

- `9a8bb86f6b9c8791e2db4030680abb32d29d475a` — DDE-065 generation-prompt compiler;
- `32ae479cd133ddab86431250fe7888623bf8453a` — DDE-066 donor discovery and feature-function taxonomy;
- `c30d2969e3205d1a277dd128e8b182137a8892e0` — DDE-067 Frontend Studio surface.

### Rev 3 source-of-truth bootstrap commits

These commits establish documentation/control-plane memory only; they do **not** advance product implementation beyond DDE-067:

- `98110744c175f5d8c83c2248962f670fa7b00748` — Blueprint Rev 3 created;
- `45624dc6a009c0eecc4bae6009d8621ff39ec09e` — Development Plan Rev 3 created;
- `fc12925ebcaa32eae880f173ea6a8e746d6bf406` — Architecture Decision index created;
- `8e460bf2a7a74bdec226ef5fbce43f8be5e65116` — initial Implementation State created;
- `1b21a195563a4c55426fd6090ed66941524d853c` — canonical Resume Prompt created;
- `fe45ba54299343ae3d70def59b439900fe85a7cc` — `AGENTS.md` switched to Rev 3 bootstrap/authority;
- `a3bfbd240820648892d11d951fe542593ad1d8b2` — `README.md` switched to Rev 3 SOT links.

This file's current commit is the close-out of the R3-0 source-of-truth migration.

## 2. Overall program state

| Area | State | Evidence / current reality |
|---|---|---|
| DDE Core control-plane foundation | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | Repository contains truth, mission/planning, routing, capability, verification, adapters, interfaces, migrations and tests; several historical EDRs explicitly describe partial implementation and remaining production-call-site gaps. |
| Rev 3 repository-memory/SOT model | `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED` | All five canonical files exist under `docs/truth`; `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` now boot new work from Rev 3 and demote Rev 2 to historical/reference depth. |
| DDE-065 Generation-Prompt Compiler | `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED` | Landed in commit `9a8bb86...`; chapter-gate document exists. Treat later regressions separately. |
| DDE-066 Donor Discovery + taxonomy | `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED` | Landed in commit `32ae479...`; accepted EDR-0015 admits the bounded egress surface; chapter-gate exists. |
| DDE-067 Frontend Studio Surface | `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED` | Landed in commit `c30d296...`; chapter gate says production call sites are wired for its scope and explicitly hands the next sequential mission to DDE-068. |
| DDE-068 Visual Verification & Critique Loop | `PLANNED` | DDE-067 chapter gate names it as next sequential mission; accepted EDR-0016 authorizes the VLM critic dependency. No DDE-068 implementation commit was found in the repo search used for this snapshot. |
| DDE-069 Mobile/Multi-target Profiles | `DEFERRED` | Planned/provisional in blueprint and Frontend Studio GUI spec; intentionally sequenced after web verification quality closes. |
| Fable 5 strategic orchestration profile | `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL` | Rev 3 role is defined, but no actual Fable 5 adapter/runtime integration was found in the observed repository state. Implement only when a supported interface is available and testable. |
| Hermes persistent research/coordination role | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | Hermes is represented in routing registry and DDE Code worker/harness UI surfaces; the full Rev 3 persistent coordination/research/recovery role still requires explicit runtime/profile hardening and evidence. |
| Claude Code worker integration | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | DDE Code/packaging references Claude Code worker setup; Rev 3 quota-aware specialization and independent-review routing still require explicit implementation/evaluation. |
| DeepSeek worker integration | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | Harness/profile references exist; Rev 3 lower-cost delegation policy and measured routing specialization remain to be proven end-to-end. |
| Frontend Studio professional Rev 3 redesign | `PLANNED` | DDE-067 surface exists and design-tooling rules exist, but Rev 3 calls for a broader professional operator-shell redesign and DDE-068 evidence integration. |
| Routing intelligence / learned policy promotion | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | Existing routing registry/telemetry/learning planning exists; open EDR/partial implementation records require careful production-call-site audit before claiming full adaptive routing. |
| Context optimization / repository memory | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | Rev 3 bootstrap removes chat history as a required project-memory source; deeper task-packet/retrieval optimization remains planned. |
| Windows complete installer / DDE Code distribution | `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` | README and packaging describe DDE Code + Core/Postgres/Redis/migrations/wizard paths; release/recovery/signing/operational hardening remains a Rev 3 phase. |

## 3. Frontend Studio detailed state

### DDE-065 — Generation-Prompt Compiler

**State:** `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED`

Observed evidence:

- implementation commit exists;
- signed Frontend Studio charter defines deterministic/fail-closed inputs;
- DDE-065 chapter gate exists;
- compiler is intended to avoid model/network calls at compile time and embed design constraints/provenance.

**Do not reopen unless:** current tests/code show regression or DDE-068/Rev 3 requires a contract amendment.

### DDE-066 — Donor Discovery & Feature-Function Taxonomy

**State:** `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED`

Observed evidence:

- implementation commit exists;
- accepted EDR-0015 authorizes brokered allowlisted donor search;
- chapter gate exists;
- search path is control-plane capability, not a worker egress bypass.

**Known operational caution:** live provider behavior still depends on correctly captured credentials/provider setup; do not confuse code-path completion with every deployment having credentials configured.

### DDE-067 — Frontend Studio Surface & Consumption Wiring

**State:** `COMPLETE_EVIDENCED` for signed DDE-067 scope.

Observed evidence:

- latest product implementation commit before Rev 3 bootstrap is named `DDE-067 Frontend Studio surface`;
- DDE Code includes Mission Overview and Hermes/Claude Code/DeepSeek views;
- Frontend Studio commands are wired through Gateway-oriented surfaces;
- chapter gate records remaining list/read gaps honestly rather than fabricating rows;
- chapter gate explicitly states DDE-068 is next.

**Residuals intentionally not charged to DDE-067:**

- DD207+ combination lints;
- silhouette distinctiveness;
- density enforcement;
- reduced-motion semantics beyond current baseline;
- rendered verification evidence as a first-class DDE verification path;
- bounded VLM critique/revision;
- D3 list endpoints / richer live read surfaces where contracts are absent.

### DDE-068 — Visual Verification & Critique Loop

**State:** `PLANNED`, next sequential mission.

**Unblocked by:** accepted EDR-0016.

**Required before completion:**

1. real visual executor behind DDE verification capability;
2. persisted screenshot/render evidence;
3. DD207+ combination lints;
4. silhouette/fingerprint gate;
5. believable-density enforcement;
6. reduced-motion semantic assertions;
7. VLM screenshot critique as rank-9 evidence;
8. bounded revision <= 3 cycles;
9. human escalation after bound;
10. real production promotion/merge gate consuming visual verdicts.

### DDE-069 — Mobile / multi-target

**State:** `DEFERRED`.

Do not expand targets before the DDE-068 quality loop is stable enough to avoid multiplying an immature pipeline.

---

## 4. Worker/orchestration state

### Fable 5

**State:** `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`.

Rev 3 defines Fable 5 as the preferred strategic orchestration worker **when a supported interface exists**. No repository evidence currently proves a functioning Fable adapter.

Next actions when available:

- define/extend generic worker profile capabilities;
- implement adapter only behind that contract;
- benchmark against alternative planner profiles;
- route outputs through draft -> validate -> promote;
- never persist authoritative state in Fable memory.

### Hermes

**State:** `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL`.

Current repository evidence:

- `engine/routing/registry.py` includes `HARNESS_HERMES`;
- DDE Code includes Hermes Mission Control/harness UI surfaces;
- packaging/README describes Hermes alongside other worker dashboards.

Rev 3 gap:

- make its persistent research/context/recovery responsibilities explicit in profile policy and production workflows;
- prove capability/credential containment;
- ensure Hermes working memory always rehydrates authoritative facts from DDE;
- collect routing quality/cost telemetry for Hermes task classes.

### Claude Code

**State:** `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL`.

Rev 3 gap:

- explicit high-complexity/high-risk task eligibility;
- quota-aware routing rather than default premium absorption;
- independent review policy;
- measured quality/cost comparison.

### DeepSeek

**State:** `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL`.

Rev 3 gap:

- explicit bounded/mechanical task eligibility;
- deterministic arbitration of parallel candidates;
- quota/health telemetry and fallback behavior.

---

## 5. Known open/partial governance items at DDE-067 handoff

The DDE-067 chapter gate records the following as unchanged/open at that point:

- EDR-0002;
- EDR-0003;
- EDR-0005;
- EDR-0027;
- EDR-0033.

Do **not** infer their final status from this summary. Read the corresponding Project Truth/EDR record before changing affected behavior.

The gate also records missing D3 list/read endpoints for some Studio surfaces. Until contracts exist, UI must remain honest rather than synthesizing rows.

---

## 6. Current risks

### RISK-01 — Documentation/code authority drift

**Current status:** mitigated for bootstrap. `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` now point to the Rev 3 truth set.

**Residual:** future architecture changes must keep all five truth files synchronized through change control.

### RISK-02 — DDE-068 becomes a documentation-only quality layer

Visual/VLM concepts already exist in planning, but completion requires real verification executors and promotion call sites.

**Mitigation:** implement DDE-068 using the vertical slices in `DEV_PLAN_REV3.md` and gate each at production paths.

### RISK-03 — Premium-model quota transfer

If Fable is unavailable, there is a temptation to make Claude Code absorb orchestration plus implementation plus review.

**Mitigation:** deterministic planning/validation + Hermes research + lower-cost bounded workers + premium escalation only for high-value reasoning.

### RISK-04 — Hermes UI presence mistaken for complete Hermes orchestration

A harness card/room is not proof of the full runtime role.

**Mitigation:** keep state `IMPLEMENTED_PARTIAL` until routing, capabilities, recovery and telemetry prove the Rev 3 role.

### RISK-05 — Frontend quality overclaim

DDE-067 landed the surface; DDE-068 is still required for rendered quality evidence.

**Mitigation:** no `Definition of Polished` or quality badge without evidence-backed DDE-068 gates.

## 7. Immediate next work packet

Unless newer implementation evidence exists:

**Mission:** DDE-068 Visual Verification & Critique Loop.

Start by auditing these areas against the signed charter and Rev 3 plan:

- `engine/verification/**`;
- visual executor/oracle bindings;
- `interfaces/dde-studio/visual/**`;
- `scripts/design_lints.py`;
- `tests/unit/test_studio_design_lints.py`;
- Gateway/verification command path;
- Evidence persistence;
- approval/promotion call sites.

First vertical slice should prove a real visual verification request can render a ProductEnvironment screen and persist an evidence-backed result.

---

## 8. Update protocol

At the end of every meaningful implementation tranche:

1. record new head/commit;
2. change only states supported by evidence;
3. list production call sites added;
4. list tests/verification evidence;
5. record residuals/blocks;
6. update immediate next work packet;
7. if architecture changed, update Blueprint/Decisions through the proper EDR/change-control path.

Never erase an earlier limitation simply because later intent says it should be fixed.
